Collection of things I've been working on when I have the time, started it many many moons ago, destined to never quite be ready

  What it does:
  =============
  
  Currently, not a great deal, but, it fetches YouTube videos (WebKit allows cross domain when you navigate to a document via file://) by grabbing the page and deconstructing something called the FMT URL Map.
  Using a combination of this, and data from the Musicbrainz API it allows you to search for an artist, then navigate to an album, click a song and start listening to it.
  
  How does it choose the video?
  =============================
  
  It actually has a basic set of filters that I've tuned over time, at first it was strictly for music videos, but I've added the option to search for just songs.
  
  Why?
  ====
  
  I wanted a way of being able to just start up the app on any device, whether it be via my desktop browser, or via my mobile phone, and be able to watch music videos.
  I didn't want adverts, and I didn't want to be using Flash.
